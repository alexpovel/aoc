/// --- Part Two ---
///
/// The engineer finds the missing part and installs it in the engine! As the engine
/// springs to life, you jump in the closest gondola, finally ready to ascend to the
/// water source.
///
/// You don't seem to be going very fast, though. Maybe something is still wrong?
/// Fortunately, the gondola has a phone labeled "help", so you pick it up and the
/// engineer answers.
///
/// Before you can explain the situation, she suggests that you look out the window.
/// There stands the engineer, holding a phone in one hand and waving with the other.
/// You're going so slowly that you haven't even left the station. You exit the gondola.
///
/// The missing part wasn't the only issue - one of the gears in the engine is wrong. A
/// gear is any * symbol that is adjacent to exactly two part numbers. Its gear ratio is
/// the result of multiplying those two numbers together.
///
/// This time, you need to find the gear ratio of every gear and add them all up so that
/// the engineer can figure out which gear needs to be replaced.
///
/// Consider the same engine schematic again:
///
/// ```text
/// 467..114..
/// ...*......
/// ..35..633.
/// ......#...
/// 617*......
/// .....+.58.
/// ..592.....
/// ......755.
/// ...$.*....
/// .664.598..
/// ```
///
/// In this schematic, there are two gears. The first is in the top left; it has part
/// numbers 467 and 35, so its gear ratio is 16345. The second gear is in the lower
/// right; its gear ratio is 451490. (The * adjacent to 617 is not a gear because it is
/// only adjacent to one part number.) Adding up all of the gear ratios produces 467835.
///
/// What is the sum of all of the gear ratios in your engine schematic?
